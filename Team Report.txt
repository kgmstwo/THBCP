Team Overall Design and Strategy:
We created Optimal and Alternative plans of action, specifying what we wanted the robots to do each season. 
Summaries of Plans (they're actually more detailed):	
Fall simple version:
Wander, find flower, take pollen back to tower
Fall complex version:
Wander, find flower in set time, take pollen back, recruit others, return to flower.
If no flower found, return and find recruiter. If no recruiter, wander again.

Winter: One function, meant to stay in the light
Simple Version: Drive towards whichever sensor(s) is (are) in the light
If no sensors in light, drive quickly in random direction
Complex Version:
Drive towards whichever sensor(s) is (are) in the light
If no sensors in light, drive towards first neighbor in light

Spring Simple Version: Everyone goes wandering
If you see a tree, return to base, become guide if no guide there, dance
If guide already at base, or return to base without finding a tree, align with guide
Go forward and find tree

Summer Simple Version:
Place queen bee (off) in center of our half
Put robots behind blocks and have them drive straight forward for set length of time
Complex Version:
Elect queen bee, have her drive to set spot
Aim robots towards queen but have some angled slightly off, so they will approach from side
Drive robots until they get a message from the queen, then towards the queen until they bump
Have robots back up and head back

We divided up the jobs of creating uniforms, creating the blocks for summer, and writing pieces of code. 
We worked (and are working) together to test, debug, and fix code.
