Plans of Action!:



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fall:

Simple version:
Send everyone to wander until finding a flower
Take pollen back to tower
Wait for human extraction (check for time passed or button press?)
Repeat

Complex version:
Send everyone to wander until finding a flower or a time has elapsed
If flower was found: 
	Drive around flower, picking up pollen
	Return to tower, recruiting others
	Wait
	Return to flower, with a chain of followers :)
If no flower was found and time ran out: 
	Return, looking for others who are recruiting
	If recruiter was found:
		Start bringing back pollen from recruiter's flower
	If no recruiter was found: Wander again



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winter:
One function, meant to stay in the light
Simple Version: Drive towards whichever sensor(s) is (are) in the light
If no sensors in light, drive quickly in random direction

Complex Version:
Drive towards whichever sensor(s) is (are) in the light
If no sensors in light, drive towards first neighbor in light
Requires all robots to be constantly transmitting and receiving

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring:

Simple Version:

Everyone goes wandering
    if you see a tree:
        go to it
        return to base
        if there is no guide there:
            you are the guide
            Dance
        else:
            align with guide
            run forward
            once you see a tree or bee at tree:
                go to it and stop
                broadcast 'im at a tree'
    else:
        return to base
        if/when there is a guide:
            align with guide
            run forward
            once you see a tree or bee at tree:
                go to it and stop
                broadcast 'im at a tree'

Notes:
Guide never makes it to tree (seems safer)

Hunter says: Is there a problem with the guide simply counting bees?


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summer:
Simple Version:
Place queen bee (off) in center of our half
Put robots behind blocks and have them drive straight forward for set length of time

Complex Version:
Elect queen bee, have her drive to set spot
Aim robots towards queen but have some angled slightly off, so they will approach from side
Drive robots until they get a message from the queen, then towards the queen until they bump
Have robots back up and head back
